<h1 align="center">The Film Circle</h1>

<p align="center"><i>The Film Circle</i> was founded in 2023, is based in Sydney Australia, and was designed to help solve the problems that actors and filmmakers face in creating and sharing their films.</p>

<p align="center">Currently, <i>The Film Circle</i> acts as a platform to help filmmakers in the Sydney film industry find the people they need to create and share their film projects. Users can sign up for free and post a job on the platform that details who they're looking for and share that job post elsewhere to enable them to find that person. Because of the way this platform is designed, the SEO makes it possible for people outside of the platform to find the job post and apply.</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Film Circle</i> intends to add features to the platform to make it easier for actors and filmmakers to connect with each other.</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Film Circle</i> is also developing other products and services for actors and filmmakers to help them solve the problems that they are facing in the film industry and is actively seeking to understand these problems in order to provide solutions for them.</p>
